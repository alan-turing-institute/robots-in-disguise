"You go to church, take it to God, and everything will be just fine. But dealing with all of his pain on his own made him lose his passion for cooking; to this day, he can’t even watch his episode of Chopped because he was in so much internal pain while filming the show."
"He was taught to push it all down, put on a mask, smile, and fake it, even when he was feeling completely broken inside. Because he says in much of the Black community, therapy is taboo, speaking to a therapist was out of the question."

"All she needed was someone to believe in her, so I gave her my number and a scholarship—and we’ve been in each other’s lives ever since. What I didn’t know then was that I was stepping into something I did not understand."
