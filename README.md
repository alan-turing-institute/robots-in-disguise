# _Robots in Disguise_: Fundamental AI Reading Group

Public repo for The Alan Turing Institute's reading group on fundamental AI research.

If you're based at the Turing, follow `#robots-in-disguise` on the Turing Slack for the most recent updates.

**To see all the slides and reading materials for previous sessions, see the [archive](PREVIOUS.md).**

Note that this originated from the [Research Engineering Team](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research-engineering)'s reading group on Transformers.

## Overview

The group meets every <b>week on Mondays at 11-12</b>. Everyone is welcome to join! If you have any questions email [Ryan Chan](mailto:rchan@turing.ac.uk), [Fede Nanni](mailto:fnanni@turing.ac.uk) or [Giulia Occhini](go292@cam.ac.uk) and remember to go through our [Code of Conduct](CodeOfConduct.md) before joining.

Please **get in touch** if you would like to give a talk (either about your research or a topic you think is relevant to the reading group) add suggestions and emoji preferences to the [list of proposed topics](https://hackmd.io/4zHl_1G6Se-yumHTN48dqg?both) on HackMD!

### Can language models play the Wikipedia game?

This project examines how Language Models can navigate Wikipedia. Which tests their ability to link semantically similar topics in a practical way. We have run experiments with a large variety of sentence embedding and large language models for comparison. We have also seen how the performance varies when transversing Wikipedia in other languages and when navigating between scientific papers, which allows an assessment of the breadth of the model's abilities.
