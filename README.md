## Background

The reading group originated from the [Research Engineering Team](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research-engineering)'s reading group on Transformers. Between 2023 and 2025, it was co-organised by [Ryan Chan](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/research-engineering/ryan-chan) and [Fede Nanni](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/federico-nanni), with the help of [Giulia Occhini](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/former-doctoral-students/giulia-occhini).
